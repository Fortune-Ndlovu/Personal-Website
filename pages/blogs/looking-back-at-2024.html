                    <div class="post-content">

                        <p class="introduction">As 2024 comes to a close, I felt it was important to think more deeply about what went right and what went wrong, so that I have the opportunity to learn. Typically I only retrospect daily and weekly, however, I have never done so yearly, starting now.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>1. How did the past year affect your life?</h4>

                        <p>Thinking about major things that happened to me and the impact of my actions on my family, and me, I would add this past year taught me discipline and resilience. Having graduated from <a href="https://tus.ie/">TUS</a> University with a First Class Honours in Full-Stack Web Development at the age of 22, receiving a return offer from <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en">Red Hat</a> as an Associate Software Engineer affected my life positively. Keep in mind I have sacrificed everything to get to where I am today because I believe to achieve my dreams one must block irrelevant distractions and focus on what they think is best for them and their family. In my case growth is important and I can only grow by being disciplined, resilient, and continuously improving.
                        </p><br>

                        <h4>2. What are you proud of accomplishing this year?</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Graduated from TUS University with a First Class Honours Degree (4 years)</li>
                            <li>Accepted an Associate Software Engineering Role at Red Hat</li>
                            <li>Spoke at <a href="https://www.nodeconf.eu/">NodeConf 2024</a> as a guest speaker</li>
                            <li>Granted a Masters Degree in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.setu.ie/courses/msc-in-computer-science-enterprise-software-systems">SETU</a> University</li>
                        </ul><br>
                        <p>The above 4 are my most proud accomplishments this year. You may be thinking “Fortune, these are all well and good and you should be proud of yourself however you could have accomplished a lot more.”— you are correct, I could have. However, I experienced a growth curve, from studying extremely hard in University to working at my dream job and learning new programming languages and skills, to speaking in front of 50+ people, which became the new norm drastically. This taught me to be more agile in transitioning to the next accomplishment after achieving a hard-earned goal, leveraging my adaptability to keep progressing.</p><br>

                    <h4>3. What went wrong and lessons learned?</h4>
                    <p>While 2024 was filled with accomplishments, no year is without its challenges. Reflecting on what did not go as planned helps me grow and refine my approach moving forward. Here is one key area I struggled with this past year and the lessons it taught me:</p><br>
                    <strong>Time Management in Balancing Learning and Opportunities</strong>
                    <p>I realized that my love for learning led me to create an overly ambitious list of learning goals, which ultimately resulted in burnout. I felt stretched thin, and some personal goals had to take a backseat.
                        This taught me an important lesson; rather than spreading myself too thin across many topics, I should focus on 2–3 key areas and excel at them before moving on. Mastery takes time—not just understanding but also applying, creating, evaluating, and analyzing what I’ve learned.
                        In 2025, I will channel this focus into three core priorities; my work, my Master’s degree, and AI. By concentrating my efforts, I aim to make meaningful progress without feeling overwhelmed.
                    </p><br>

                    <h4>4. How will you be hitting the ground running in 2025?</h4>
                    <p>To hit the ground running in 2025, maintaining positivity, confidence, and focus will be crucial. Staying disciplined and eliminating distractions will ensure that I channel my energy into meaningful progress. Believe in your abilities because you do your homework, you strive where complexity reigns, and most importantly you want to make a positive impact on others around you. With that being said below are the accomplishments I want to achieve and continue in 2025:</p><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Continue Masters Degree in Computer Science at SETU University - I love learning and being academically educated.
                        </li>
                        <li>Continue excelling at my role as a Software Engineer and providing value to our customers - This makes me proud and happy.
                        </li>
                        <li>Continue conference speaking - I plan on sharing my knowledge with 50+ more people.
                        </li>
                        <li>Write and share more blogs, articles, and courses - Instead of keeping my writing locked in my Notion, I will be uploading them on the web for others to read and learn from. Aiming to upload 12-18.
                        </li>
                        <li>Continue learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) - I am been doing a course on <a href="https://grow.google/intl/en_pk/guide-ai-machine-learning/">AI and Machine learning</a> and I am loving it so far.
                        </li>
                        <li>Get more certifications initially aiming for 3.
                        </li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <p>2025 is not a time for thinking about what you are going to do, it is about taking action and achieving your goals. I will be achieving my goals simply by continuing to keep my head down, being resilient, and disciplined, and sharing my knowledge with others. Let’s make 2025 our greatest year, yet!</p>
