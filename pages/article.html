                            we must ensure no one gets left behind. Web Accessibility is a key factor in this evolution.

                        <p>All websites and web tools are accessible to everyone less than 1% by default. However, it is
                            up to us designers and
                            developers to increase this percentage to at least 99.9%.</p><br>
                        <p>In this article, we will take a good look at what, why, and how including case studies on Web
                            Accessibility. Let us proceed!</p><br><br>


                        <h3 id="what-is-web-accessibility">What is Web Accessibility?</h3>
                        <p>Web Accessibility is the implementation within the inclusive practice of ensuring your
                            website and web tools have no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, and are
                            usable by as many people as possible.</p><br>
                        <p>This means when we are designing and developing, we do not only think about people with
                            disabilities that may include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mental</li>
                            <li>Physical</li>
                            <li>Cognitive</li>
                            <li>Intellectual</li>
                        </ul><br>
                        <p>but make websites and web tools that are also accessible for people without disabilities,
                            that may include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>People using mobile devices, and other devices with small screens</li>
                            <li>Older folks, with changing abilities due to aging</li>
                            <li>People with temporary injuries such as broken arm</li>
                            <li>Or those with slow network connections</li>
                        </ul><br>
                        <p>We are all human, we are made from the same of the same flesh and blood, and we may be
                            uniquely different, but we are
                            all human. Providing accessible sites and tools is the right thing to do no matter the
                            person's ability or circumstance.</p><br>
                        <p>Let us take a closer look at the importance of Web Accessibility.</p><br><br>
                        <h3 id="why-is-web-accessibility-important">Why is Web Accessibility important?</h3>
                        <p>As the World Wide Web is evolving, making websites and web tools accessible to everyone is
                            not just an ethics question. Although designing and developing websites and web tools while
                            making them accessible is unquestionably the right thing to do, it is also a legal
                            obligation in many jurisdictions, including most of Europe and the United States.</p><br>
                        <p>Your country will probably have laws governing Web Accessibility, the W3C keeps a list of <a
                                href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/" target="_blank">Web Accessibility Laws &
                                Policies by
                                country.</a> It is important to check out the specifics of your country to find out what
                            your laws are because if no effort is made and people complain, you could be legally liable.
                        </p><br>
                        <h4>Businesses</h4>
                        <p>Web Accessibility is also important for businesses. Beyond legal obligations and
                            unquestionably being the right thing to do, Web Accessibility can help you strengthen your
                            brand in business terms. With an accessible website or web tool you are aware and care of
                            your customers and their needs.</p><br>
                        <p>By making a long-term commitment to accessibility, you increase the chances of your website
                            being found on search engine optimization (SEO) which drives more traffic to your website by
                            increasing its ranking in search engines. When you also offer a great user experience
                            meaning all users can find what they are looking for effortlessly, you reach a wider
                            audience increasing market reach and driving innovation.</p><br><br>
                        <h4>Society & Individuals</h4>
                        <p>Society and all individuals need Web Accessibility because improving web accessibility brings
                            an increased quality of life. This means more independence and better social integration.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>The Web is an increasingly important resource, therefor improving accessibility within can
                            also increase education, employment, and health care. Education allows us to use logic when
                            making decisions while developing our critical thinking.</p><br>
                        <p>A person with a disability is more likely to be unemployed than a person without a
                            disability, therefor embracing accessibility we gain access to new talent, and it also leads
                            to better health and can result in cost savings in several areas. By creating accessible
                            websites and web tools that do not exclude people, the results can be rewarding.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Let us dive right into the implementation of Web Accessibility.</p><br><br>

                        <h3 id="how-can-we-implement-web-accessibility">How can we implement Web Accessibility?</h3>
                        <p>Web Accessibility should be considered from the very beginning of our projects. Just as we
                            design and develop for a
                            specific target audience, we now include disabled users. We must test early and often for
                            missing features such as <a
                                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Accessibility#text_alternatives"
                                target="_blank">alternative
                                text</a>, links that are being used as buttons, or bad link text.</p><br>
                        <p>Ask yourself:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Can users navigate within the interface using just the keyboard?</li>
                            <li>Is my interactive content usable for people using just screen readers?</li>
                            <li>When my links open in a new tab will visually impaired people know about it?</li>
                        </ul><br>
                        <p>We can and must keep note of potential problem areas within our content and try our best to
                            fix them as part of our workflow.</p><br>
                        <p>With numerous checklists and sets of guidelines out there available for accessibility to be
                            tested, it all may be overwhelming at first glance. A nice place to start is with the World
                            Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The Consortium is made up of member organizations that maintain
                            full-time staff working together in the development of standards for the World Wide Web.
                            Founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee the inventor of the World Wide Web.</p><br>
                        <p>The W3C has established a body of guidelines for assessing web accessibility, these are
                            called the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank">Web
                                Content
                                Accessibility Guidelines</a> (WCAG), the document is large but precise. These guidelines
                            describe a set of criteria that are split up into four main
                            categories, perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. We can use the criteria that
                            are split up but
                            complementary to test our website or web tool content for accessibility as we must follow
                            them.</p><br>
                        <h5>Perceivable:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Content that can be perceived equally using more than one sense.</li>
                            <li>Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they
                                can perceive meaning easily realized and understood.</li>
                        </ul><br>
                        <h5>Operable:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Websites can be used regardless of device.</li>
                            <li>User interface components and navigation must be operable meaning keyboard accessible
                                and no barriers to any relevant information.</li>
                        </ul><br>
                        <h5>Understandable:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Users can understand the content and navigation.</li>
                            <li>Information and user interface components must be easily read and predictably operable.
                            </li>
                        </ul><br>
                        <h5>Robust:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Website or web tool works with assistive technologies.</li>
                            <li>Information and user interface components must be strong enough that they can be
                                reliable to work swiftly with assistive technologies while being healthy for all users.
                            </li>
                        </ul><br>
                        <p>All of these principles work together to help you create websites and web tools that are
                            accessible to everyone. By
                            default, we need to be designing clean and consistent layouts including writing predictable
                            and concise code.</p><br>
                        <p>For keeping your design layouts clean and consistent you can have a look at <a

                                    not providing users who are deaf with equal access to its “watch instantly” video

                                streaming titles, despite repeated requests from the NAD dating back to 2009, and that
                                by failing to provide captions Netflix increases the sense of isolation and stigma
