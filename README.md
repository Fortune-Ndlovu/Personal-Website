# Personal-Website
A site for experimenting by implementing.

note: The overall code is pretty simple for now. 

## HTML
I am using font-awesome for the icons and bootstrap for the form and buttons; however, I modified bootstrap to suit my needs e.g. I turned off border-radius for buttons because I wanted sharp edges. 
I am using flexbox for content layout. Flexbox makes it really easy to align content and maintain a consistent layout. 
The form works, with the help of formsubmit.co as the action provided with my siteâ€™s email address.

## CSS
I am using one style sheet for now because the website is only in its first draft. The overall styles are pretty simple from the navigation to media queries. What is interesting is that I am using CSS variables for my colors. I will be adding more custom variables as the site progresses. 

## JavaScript
The only time I used JavaScript in this instance was for the activation of the hamburger menu, the image slider including the pricing per build buttons. The code is simplified and concise. 

## Accessibility 
The website is accessible I made various tests before launching. I followed the WCAG guidelines from the very beginning of my project. However, there is still room for improvement especially as the site progresses.
I am really interested in web accessibility and trying very hard to master the knowledge and skill, I will get there. 

## Conclusion 
I designed, developed, and tested following the WCAG guidelines and repeated these four steps as part of my workflow. The code is super simple as this is the first draft. I will continue to add advanced features but more importantly, ensure content is accessible.
